# Protecting Privacy and Balancing Advanced Technologies

The goal is to protect individuals' privacy and privacy rights and find a balance between using advanced technologies and protecting users' privacy rights. Based on this research, I will be facilitating an organization. I will recommend new policies or modifications to their existing policies to protect them from the side effects of Artificial Intelligence.

## Limits of Current Practice

The magnitude of the ill effects still needs to be discovered by many organizations, especially new start-ups and small-scale organizations with fewer resources. Thus, their current policies might not be enough to handle the complexities of Data Processing by AI. They might need new policies that are created keeping AI in mind and modifications to their existing policies to safeguard data privacy.

The current AI policies known to small-scale organizations might not be enough for all types of data and data models. Exploring different data models and tailoring AI policies according to the data models would prove to be a beneficial approach to improve security practices in place.

With the growing use of AI and new features of AI being introduced every day, organizations need to be prepared to protect their data from adversaries. Technologies like "Deepfake" technology, which "blurs the line between fact and fiction [1]," with its ability to create digital puppets, can easily be used by an adversary to create scandals [1]. This technology can be used against any influential individual, even authorities of a company, to spread false news and to attack any company's reputation, potentially mirroring the look and feel and content of their webpages to perform a sophisticated phishing attack. These companies would require different policies included in their security policies to prevent or act as a deterrent to such incidents.

On one hand, it is important for companies to keep their content private to their users, but it may also be worthwhile to allow some public data scraping or crawling as people might turn towards conversational agents like ChatGPT as a replacement for traditional search engines like Google. Although no survey was found to support this theory [2].
