### My story
Back in high school, I got super curious about tech stuff. Computers, hardware, software - you name it, I was fascinated! I was always wondering how the internet handled its connectivity and security.

As I grew up, I got into working on mobile phone programs and realized how organizations keep their data safe. I even had some sessions with cool cybersecurity experts like the famous Tech Guru Ankit Fadia during my high school and college days, and that just fueled my passion for this field.

Outside of all this techy stuff, I enjoy Art. 
I sing, paint, and dabble in writing. I've got this Instagram and YouTube channel where I share my creative side - it has over 2.2K views and 444 subscribers! Oh, and Rangolis (those intricate Indian color sand patterns) I really enjoy making those.

I'm a bookworm too; you'll often find me nose-deep in fiction novels during my free time. But that's not all. I'm a doer - an activist. I've worked with Anant Aman Social Welfare Society, a non-profit that's all about improving rural education. That's where I learned to think outside the box and solve problems with limited resources.

I'm all about women's empowerment and support it actively. I volunteer and donate for Seva Bharti Girls Hostel, helping underprivileged kids finish their school education. I'm also into meditation and spirituality through the Heartfulness Organization. I've hosted over 15 college events and been part of the core organizing committee for four years.

Oh, and I was one of the five people who started the Entrepreneurship Awareness Camp and founded Riyaaz Music Club in the University. We introduced students to entrepreneurs for career advice. I've also written and reported for Amogh Photography Club and Blood Donation Camps. Doing all this keeps me cool under pressure and super empathetic in my daily life.
